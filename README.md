# Laska 2077

![alt text](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/Laska-2077/blob/main/lask-2070-logo.png?raw=true)

This project was made for our Introduction to Programming course. 
It represents a digital mini-version of the famous tablegame, Lasca.
Plus, it is inspired from THAT new futuristic game featuring Keanu Reeves.

Check out the official site of the game, here: http://www.lasca.org/

### Installing

Simply download the source code from this page and run it through the following commands in your unix terminal:

```
gcc main.c 
./a.out
```

If you have Windows, after installing a software and a gcc compiler, you just need to import the files and run the main.c in release mode.
You can also get them from VCS: 
You can do this both in CLion or Visual Studio.


And play the game to show the machine, or your opponent, who's the best.

The rules for this game are to be found inside the game and many reminders are thrown whenever a player violates them.
These are some kinds of error messages you could get while playing:

```
"The selected box doesn't exist. Please select a letter from _ to _ ."

"FORCING CAPTURE - Pieces must capture if in a position to do so."

"The Dama (promoted pawn) may capture only in the 4 diagonals if the adjacet is a foe's pawn and the next on the diagonal is free."

"The pawn may capture only in the 2 diagonals forward if the adjacet is a foe's pawn and the next on the diagonal is free."

### Standard & Style

We follwed ANSI C 90 Standard rules to build this project.
The code style is snake_case type.

```
int foo_aux(int sup){

 ** Variable Declaration/ Memory allocation **
 int aux_temp;
 double a = 0.0;

 ** Statements/ Body of function **
 aux = sup;

 if(aux){
    a = 0.1;
 }
 aux = (int)a;
 
 ** Return statemente/ Memory deallocation **
 return aux_temp;
}
```


### Disclaimer

Follow the instructions given or the program will fail.
Some messages may be shown multiple times, that is a "reward" for following the rules.
