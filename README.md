# Laska 2077

This project was made for our Introduction to Programming Course. It represent the digital mini-version of the famous tablegame, Lasca.
Check out the official site of the game, here: http://www.lasca.org/

The rules for this game are to be found inside the game and many reminders are thrown whenever a player violates them.

### Prerequisites
Mac Os & Linux:
- Unix Terminal
- Gcc compiler

Or

Windows:
- Visual Studio
- CLion

### Installing
Simply download the source code from this page and run it through the following commands:

```
gcc laska.c 
./a.out
```

If you have Windows, after installing these two softwares you just need to run the main.c in release mode.
You can do this both in CLion or Visual Studio.


And play the game to show the machine, or your opponent, who's the best.
