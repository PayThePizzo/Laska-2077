# Laska 2077

This project was made for our Introduction to Programming course. 
It represent the digital mini-version of the famous tablegame, Lasca. 
Plus, it is inspired from THAT new futuristic game featuring Keanu Reeves.

Check out the official site of the game, here: http://www.lasca.org/

The rules for this game are to be found inside the game and many reminders are thrown whenever a player violates them.
